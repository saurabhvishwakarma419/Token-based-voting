# Token-based Voting

## Project Description

Token-based Voting is a decentralized governance smart contract built on Ethereum that enables transparent and democratic decision-making through blockchain technology. The system allows token holders to create proposals, vote on them using their token weight, and automatically execute proposals that achieve majority consensus. 

The contract implements a simple yet powerful voting mechanism where each token represents one vote, creating a fair and transparent governance framework suitable for DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations), community projects, and decentralized applications.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to democratize decision-making processes by leveraging blockchain technology to create transparent, tamper-proof, and inclusive voting systems. We aim to empower communities, organizations, and DAOs to govern themselves without relying on centralized intermediaries. By making governance accessible and verifiable on-chain, we seek to build trust and participation in decentralized ecosystems.

## Key Features

- **Token-weighted Voting**: Each token held represents voting power, ensuring proportional representation
- **Proposal Creation**: Any token holder can create proposals with customizable voting periods
- **Transparent Vote Tracking**: All votes are recorded on-chain and publicly verifiable
- **Automated Execution**: Proposals that achieve majority votes (>50%) can be executed automatically

## Future Scope

1. **Delegation System**: Allow token holders to delegate their voting power to trusted representatives

2. **Quadratic Voting**: Implement quadratic voting to prevent whale dominance and give smaller holders more influence

3. **Multi-tier Governance**: Create different proposal categories with varying voting thresholds and requirements

4. **Proposal Deposits**: Require proposers to stake tokens when creating proposals to prevent spam
